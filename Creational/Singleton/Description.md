# Singleton Pattern

## 🔄 How It Works

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. All requests use the same object.

## ✅ Pros

Single Instance - Only one instance exists globally

Global Access - Available everywhere in the app

Memory Efficient - Avoids multiple instances

Lazy Initialization - Created only when needed

## ❌ Cons

Global State - Shared state can cause bugs

Hard to Test - Difficult to isolate for testing

Tight Coupling - Classes depend on the singleton

Hidden Dependencies - Dependencies aren't explicit
